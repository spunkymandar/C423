Conceptual & Theoretical
1.	What are the internal differences between a simple view and a complex view in terms of query optimization and updatability?
2.	Can you explain how view resolution works internally in MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server/Oracle? How does the query engine expand views during execution?
3.	How do indexed/materialized views differ from normal views? In which scenarios would you choose one over the other?
4.	Can you describe situations where a view might cause performance degradation instead of improvement?
5.	How does the use of WITH CHECK OPTION in a view affect insert and update operations? Give real-world examples.
6.	What are the limitations of updating data through a view? How does this differ across RDBMS vendors (MySQL vs. Oracle vs. SQL Server)?
7.	Explain how schema binding affects views. Why would you use WITH SCHEMABINDING in SQL Server, and what are its pros/cons?
8.	How do views interact with triggers defined on base tables? If you perform DML through a view, how are triggers executed?
9.	What happens if you drop a column in a base table that is being used in multiple views? How do RDBMS engines handle view invalidation?
10.	Explain security implications of views. How can you use views to implement row-level or column-level security without exposing the underlying schema?

Query & Problem-Solving
11.	Write a query to create a view that shows employees with their latest salary record, where salary changes are tracked in a history table.
12.	Suppose you have a view that joins 5 tables with aggregations. How would you debug a situation where the view executes very slowly but each table independently queries fast?
13.	Write a query using a view to return only those customers who have placed orders in at least 3 consecutive months.
14.	Create a view that masks sensitive data (e.g., showing only the last 4 digits of a credit card number). How would you ensure users cannot bypass this restriction?
15.	You have a view that joins Orders, Customers, and Products. The view is used frequently in dashboards. How would you optimize it if the query plan shows repeated full table scans?
16.	How can you implement row-level filtering logic (for example, only showing sales data for the logged-in region) using views in SQL Server/Oracle/Postgres?
17.	Create a view that shows only the top N records per group (e.g., top 3 highest-selling products per category). Which approach would you use to ensure performance?
18.	If you have a nested view (a view built on top of another view, and so on), how do you troubleshoot performance issues? Would you recommend denormalizing them into a single query? Why or why not?
19.	Suppose a reporting team is querying a view that aggregates billions of rows daily. Would you recommend materialized views or indexed views? Justify with technical reasoning.
20.	Can you simulate a scenario where an updatable view produces ambiguous results when updating multiple underlying tables? How would you handle it?
